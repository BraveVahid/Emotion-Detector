A deep learning-based system for detecting human emotions from facial expressions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

</div>

## 📋 Overview

This project implements an emotion recognition system that can classify facial expressions into 7 different emotions:
- 😠 Angry
- 🤢 Disgust
- 😨 Fear
- 😊 Happy
- 😐 Neutral
- 😢 Sad
- 😲 Surprise

The model is trained on the **FER2013 dataset** and achieves approximately **66% accuracy** on the test set.

> **⚠️ Note**: This is a work-in-progress project. Future versions will include:
> - Higher accuracy models (transfer learning with pre-trained networks)
> - Real-time emotion detection using webcam
> - Enhanced preprocessing techniques
> - Model optimization for edge devices
> - Web-based demo interface


## ✨ Features

- **Custom CNN Architecture**: Deep convolutional neural network with batch normalization and dropout
- **Data Augmentation**: Comprehensive augmentation pipeline to improve model generalization
- **Class Balancing**: Automatic class weight calculation to handle imbalanced dataset
- **Training Monitoring**: Callbacks for early stopping, learning rate reduction, and model checkpointing
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Detailed performance metrics, confusion matrix, and misclassification analysis


## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git LFS (for model files)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BraveVahid/facial_emotion_recognition.git
cd facial_emotion_recognition
```

2. **Install Git LFS** (if not already installed)
```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install git-lfs

# On macOS
brew install git-lfs

# Initialize Git LFS
git lfs install
```

3. **Install required packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Download the FER2013 dataset**
- Download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
- Extract and place in the `data/` directory with the following structure:
```
data/
└── fer2013/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── angry/
    │   ├── disgust/
    │   ├── fear/
    │   ├── happy/
    │   ├── neutral/
    │   ├── sad/
    │   └── surprise/
    └── test/
        ├── angry/
        ├── disgust/
        ├── fear/
        ├── happy/
        ├── neutral/
        ├── sad/
        └── surprise/
```


## 💻 Usage

### Training the Model
```bash
python -m src.train
```

**Training parameters** (can be modified in `src/train.py`):
- `batch_size`: 64
- `epochs`: 100
- Automatic early stopping with patience of 15 epochs
- Learning rate reduction on plateau

### Evaluating the Model

Open and run the `reports.ipynb` notebook to:
- Load the trained model
- Evaluate on test dataset
- Generate classification report
- Visualize confusion matrix
- Analyze misclassified samples


## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The model consists of:

**Convolutional Blocks:**
- 4 convolutional blocks with increasing filter sizes (64 → 128 → 256 → 512)
- Batch normalization after each convolution
- ReLU activation
- Max pooling (2×2)
- Dropout layers (0.25 → 0.3 → 0.4 → 0.5)

**Fully Connected Layers:**
- Flatten layer
- Dense layer (1024 neurons) + BatchNorm + Dropout (0.5)
- Dense layer (512 neurons) + BatchNorm + Dropout (0.5)
- Output layer (7 neurons, softmax activation)

**Regularization:**
- L2 regularization (0.0001) on all layers
- Dropout at multiple stages
- Data augmentation during training

**Total Parameters:** ~10.5M
